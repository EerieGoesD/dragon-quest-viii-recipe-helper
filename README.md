# Dragon Quest VIII Alchemy Tracker

## Overview
The **Dragon Quest VIII Alchemy Tracker** is a lightweight, browser-based tool to help Dragon Quest VIII players track **inventory**, **Alchemy Pot recipes**, and overall **crafting progress**. It calculates which recipes are currently craftable based on your inventory ticks and saves your progress locally in your browser (with export/import support).

## About
I’m [EERIE](https://linktr.ee/eeriegoesd). I made this tracker as a simple way to manage Dragon Quest VIII alchemy progress in one place.

## Future Plans
If the tool proves helpful, I may add:
- Search + sorting for recipes/inventory
- More detailed optimizer logic (constraints/tradeoffs)
- Extra QoL filters (only uncreated, only craftable, etc.)
