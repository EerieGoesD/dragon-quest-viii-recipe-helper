# Dragon Quest VIII Tracker (Alchemy, Inventory, Craftable, Optimizer)

## Overview
The **Dragon Quest VIII Tracker** is a browser-based tool that combines an **item/inventory tracker**, an **alchemy recipe tracker**, a **craftable-recipe calculator**, and an **equipment optimizer** for *Dragon Quest VIII*. As you tick the items and equipment you own, the tool updates which recipes are craftable, tracks which recipes you’ve created, and can calculate recommended equipment based on the gear currently marked in your inventory. Progress is saved locally in the browser, with optional JSON export/import.
