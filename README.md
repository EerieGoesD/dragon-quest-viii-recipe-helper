# Dragon Quest VIII Alchemy Tracker

## Overview
The **Dragon Quest VIII Alchemy Tracker** is a browser-based tool for tracking **Alchemy Pot recipes**, **inventory**, and **recipe completion** in *Dragon Quest VIII*. Based on the items and equipment you tick in the inventory, it determines which recipes are currently craftable and stores progress locally in the browser, with optional JSON export/import. It also includes an **Equipment Optimizer** that selects the best available gear per character from your tracked inventory (highest Attack weapon and highest Defence armour/shield/helmet).
